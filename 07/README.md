## Solution

##### Please the index.html file for plots

#### 1
A is invalid as x**y cannot be evaluated for negative x

#### 2
b is a supercritical bifurcation


#### 3
c is a subcritical bifurcation. Can be verified due to there being hysteresis on changing mu value. Large amplitude solutions exist.
